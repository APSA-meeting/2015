          <!-- Poster Guidelines -->
          <h2>Poster Guidlines</h2>

          <h3>Poster Specifics</h3>
          <p>
          Your poster must be no larger than 4 feet high by 4 feet wide. The presenting author must be at the poster board during the presentation time. Presenters are not required to be present during all viewing hours. Posters will be judged during the presentation time for scientific novelty, quality, and presentation clarity by members of the ASCI, AAP, and APSA. Best poster awards (see Awards) will be presented on Saturday afternoon to the most outstanding poster presenters.
          </p>
          <h3>Poster Tips</h3>
          <p>
          A poster is a visual presentation of your research or clinical project. Use schematic diagrams, graphs, tables and other strategies to direct the visual attention of the viewer, rather than explaining it using text as you would in a journal article.
          </p>
          <p>
