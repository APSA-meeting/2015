          <h3>Author Attendance Requirement</h3>
          <p>
          Submission of an abstract to the APSA Annual Meeting affirms that at least one author must register for and attend the meeting if the abstract is accepted for poster or oral presentation. At least one author must be present at the poster during the scheduled presentation session. Presenters are not required to be present during all viewing hours.
          </p>

          <!-- Presentation Guidlines -->
          <h3>Presentation Guidelines</h3>
		  <h4>Size</h4>
		  <p>Your poster must be no larger than 4 feet high by 4 feet wide. Two posters will be presented side-by-side on each board.  Pushpins will be provided.</p>
		  
		  <h4>Structure</h4>
		  <p>A poster addresses one central question. State the question or hypothesis clearly in the poster and use your presentation to provide a clear and explicit take-home message. Posters usually have a similar structure to a research paper or journal article, which include the following sections: an abstract, introduction (i.e. brief rationale or review of relevant research), methods, results, and a conclusion or summary. If your poster is more clinically oriented, you may elect to use a different format, but breaking things down into clear sections with headings will help your colleagues understand your poster easily and quickly.</p>
		  
		  <p>A poster is a visual presentation of your research or clinical project. Use schematic diagrams, graphs, tables and other strategies to direct the visual attention of the viewer, rather than explaining it using text as you would in a journal article.</p>

          </p>

		  <h4>Format</h4>
		  <ul>
			<li>Do not exceed the 4 feet x 4 feet poster dimensions. Be considerate of other presenters.</li>
			<li>Use bullet points to simplify sections like the introduction and conclusions.</li>
			<li>Use large type, such as 36-point type for section headings, and 24-point type for text. Never use type smaller than 18 point for any reason.</li>
			<li>Make effective use of underlines and bold.</li>
			<li>Use graphs and figures whenever possible.</li>
			<li>Make your poster visually pleasing and attractive.</li>
			<li>Include your poster number in a large type on your poster so attendees can easily locate your abstract.</li>
		  </ul>
			
		  <h3>Best Poster Awards</h3>
		  <p>Best Poster Awards will be awarded in the amount of $1,000 each. Members of the ASCI and AAP (including members of each Council) will judge posters on scientific novelty, quality and clarity of presentation. Awards will be presented on Saturday afternoon during Plenary III.</p>
